  Use when the user explicitly asks to debug or fix multiple unrelated issues in parallel, or when
  there are 3 or more clearly independent failures that can be investigated separately. Do not use
  when symptoms may share a root cause, when sequencing matters, or when the problem has not been
  decomposed yet.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This skill orchestrates real Agent tool executions. Non-negotiable rules:
1. Prove the failures do not share a root cause before parallelizing them.
2. Write a complete prompt for every spawned agent because fresh `subagent_type` agents do not inherit task context.
3. Launch all parallel agents in a single assistant message with multiple `Agent(...)` tool uses.
4. Use `run_in_background: true` for independent debug lanes and do not poll background output.
5. Use `isolation: "worktree"` for debug lanes that may modify code.

# Run Parallel Agents Feature Debug

## Inputs

- `$request`: Optional problem set, failure list, or user direction such as `debug these three failing suites in parallel` or `split these bugs across agents`.

## Goal

Exploit Claude Code's real parallel agent runtime to diagnose and fix independent failures concurrently without splitting one root cause into multiple conflicting investigations.

## Step 0: Resolve the candidate debug lanes

Identify the failure set:

- explicit user bug list
- failing test groups
- broken subsystems
- grouped compile, lint, runtime, or performance failures

Then determine:

- failure count
- likely subsystem boundaries
- whether each failure is a symptom or a standalone issue
- whether the lanes are debug/fix work rather than planning or broad exploration

Do not use this skill if:

- there are fewer than 3 independent lanes
- the failures may share one root cause
- one broken dependency, config value, schema change, or deploy event could explain multiple symptoms
- the work still needs decomposition before execution

Use `AskUserQuestion` only if safe clustering depends on user clarification.

**Success criteria**: You have a concrete set of candidate debug lanes worth triaging for independence.

## Step 1: Prove independence and reject shared-root-cause traps

For each candidate lane, check:

- whether the failure started at the same time as other lanes
- whether the same dependency, config, migration, environment, or upstream service appears in multiple traces
- whether one fix could plausibly collapse several symptoms
- whether the write scope is disjoint if multiple lanes reach the fix stage

Parallelize only when:

- root cause is plausibly distinct
- reproduction is lane-local
- expected fixes do not overlap heavily

If there is meaningful doubt, do not parallelize yet. Diagnose the shared root cause first.

Load `references/debug_patterns.md` for root-cause heuristics and framework-specific failure patterns.
Load `references/agent-runtime-semantics.md` for the runtime rules that make or break parallel debug execution.

**Success criteria**: Every selected lane is likely independent at both diagnosis and fix time.

## Step 2: Match each debug lane to the right agent

Choose the most appropriate specialized agent for each lane based on:

- framework and language
- failing files and directories
- error signatures
- whether the lane is runtime, test, build, or performance focused

Load `references/agent_matching_logic.md` for detailed matching rules and edge cases.

Practical defaults:

- use the most specific framework/domain agent available
- use `general-purpose` only when no stronger fit exists
- do not invent agent types

**Success criteria**: Every lane has a justified debug agent assignment.

## Step 3: Build full debugging briefs

Because fresh `subagent_type` agents start without the main thread's task context, every prompt must contain:

- the exact problem statement
- the concrete error or symptom
- reproduction steps, if known
- affected files or directories
- likely scope boundaries
- what counts as success
- required verification command or test
- whether the lane should only diagnose or both diagnose and fix

Prefer real evidence over summaries:

- failing command output
- stack trace excerpts
- failing test names
- impacted file paths

Do not hand a fresh agent vague instructions like "fix this suite" without the actual failure surface.

**Success criteria**: Each lane prompt is complete enough for a fresh agent to diagnose without basic follow-up questions.

## Step 4: Launch all agents in one parallel batch

Launch every lane in a single assistant message containing multiple `Agent(...)` tool uses.

Required launch semantics for fix-capable debug lanes:

- `subagent_type`: matched agent type
- `description`: short 3-5 word description
- `prompt`: full debugging brief
- `run_in_background: true`
- `isolation: "worktree"`

Runtime-specific rules:

- do not split the launches across multiple assistant messages if the user asked for parallel debugging
- do not rely on target-agent defaults for async or isolation when parallel safety matters
- do not use read-only forks here; this skill is for fresh specialized debug agents

Load `references/agent-runtime-semantics.md` for the exact source-backed reasons behind these rules.

**Success criteria**: All independent debug lanes are launched concurrently with explicit, safe runtime settings.

## Step 5: Aggregate completions without polling

After launch:

- continue with non-overlapping coordination work
- wait for completion notifications instead of polling background transcripts
- trust returned agent summaries unless there is a concrete reason to inspect deeper

When each lane completes, capture:

- status
- diagnosed root cause
- files touched
- verification result
- blockers or unresolved scope

If a lane concludes the issue was not independent after all, stop pretending the original clustering was valid and reframe the remaining work.

**Success criteria**: Every spawned lane has a tracked outcome without unnecessary transcript noise.

## Step 6: Validate fixes and check for conflicts

Before treating the parallel debug session as complete:

- rerun the original failing test or validation command for each lane
- confirm the original symptom is actually gone
- check for overlapping file edits or contradictory fixes
- confirm one lane did not silently re-break another lane's subsystem

If conflicts exist:

- stop automatic aggregation
- identify the overlapping files or contradictory fixes
- merge intentionally or escalate to the user

If multiple lanes converged on the same root cause:

- say so explicitly
- consolidate the result instead of pretending they were independent wins

**Success criteria**: The final result reflects real fixes, not just parallel patch attempts.

## Step 7: Report the consolidated result

Summarize:

- which debug lanes ran
- which agents handled them
- root cause and fix status per lane
- verification result per lane
- conflicts, converged root causes, or remaining blockers

Be explicit about partial success. Debugging is only finished when the original failures are actually resolved or clearly re-scoped.

**Success criteria**: The user gets a concise but accurate parallel-debug summary.

## Guardrails

- Do not use this skill for fewer than 3 genuinely independent lanes.
- Do not parallelize symptoms that may share a root cause.
- Do not keep giant examples, scorecards, or framework catalogs inline in `SKILL.md`.
- Do not assume fresh agents know the surrounding task context.
- Do not poll or tail background agent output unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not rely on default agent `background` or `isolation` settings when explicit launch parameters are safer.
- Do not add `disable-model-invocation`; this skill should remain available when the user asks for parallel debugging.
- Do not add `context: fork`; this workflow coordinates fresh specialized agents, not read-only skill forks.
- Do not add `paths:`; this is a generic orchestration skill.

## When To Load References

- `references/agent-runtime-semantics.md`
  Use for source-backed Agent runtime rules: fresh context, single-message parallel launch, background behavior, worktree isolation, and explicit parameter precedence.

- `references/debug_patterns.md`
  Use for shared-root-cause heuristics, framework-specific error patterns, and triage guidance.

- `references/agent_matching_logic.md`
  Use for detailed agent-selection rules and framework-specific edge cases.

## Output Contract

Report:

1. resolved debug lane set
2. agent assignment per lane
3. launch status
4. root cause and fix status per lane
5. verification results
6. conflicts, shared-cause discoveries, or remaining blockers

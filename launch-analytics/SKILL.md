  Instrument a launch so the traffic spike is measurable and attributable — define one consistent UTM
  scheme for every launch link, wire the key conversion events (visit → signup → activation) into GA4
  (or the project's existing analytics), and set up a quick validation + read-out. Parameterized by the
  launch source (e.g. producthunt, hackernews) so each link and report is correctly attributed. Shared
  building block for the launch-skill family: invoked by `launch-product-hunt`, `launch-hacker-news`, and
  others to close the measurement loop, or run standalone to add UTMs + event tracking to any campaign.
  Writes the UTM map and event plan to `.ulpi/launch/<channel>/analytics.md`. Measures durable outcomes
  (signups, activation), not just upvotes/visits; never collects PII in links or events.

when_to_use: |
  Use when a launch needs attribution: a UTM scheme for the launch links, event tracking for signups and
  activation, and a way to read the traffic spike. Examples: "add UTMs and tracking for my Product Hunt
  launch", "how do I measure launch-day signups", "wire GA4 events for the launch". Also invoked by
  platform launch skills to tag links and instrument conversions. Do not use for full product analytics
  architecture or BI dashboards — this is launch-scoped attribution.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This skill instruments a launch for attribution. Non-negotiable rules:

1. NO PII IN LINKS OR EVENTS. Never put emails, names, or identifiers in UTM parameters or event params.
   Honor the project's consent/cookie/GDPR setup; if consent gating exists, don't bypass it.
2. ONE CONSISTENT SCHEME. Define the UTM convention once (lowercase, documented), and use it for every
   launch link across listing, outreach, and social — inconsistent tags fragment the report.
3. DON'T BREAK EXISTING ANALYTICS. Detect the project's current stack first; extend it, never duplicate a
   tag manager or double-fire `page_view`. If GA4 isn't present, propose adding it — don't assume it.
4. MEASURE DURABLE OUTCOMES. Track the funnel to **signup and activation**, not just visits/upvotes — the
   launch's value is the emails and activated users it produces, not the vanity spike.
5. VERIFY THE SNIPPET AGAINST CURRENT DOCS. GA4/gtag specifics change; confirm event syntax against the
   current Google docs (use a docs/`find-docs` skill) before pasting code, and adapt to the real stack.
6. NEVER FABRICATE NUMBERS. Set up the measurement; report only what the tools actually show.
7. WRITE THE KIT TO DISK at `.ulpi/launch/<channel>/analytics.md` (create the directory if needed) — a
   durable, paste-ready artifact, not advice that scrolls away.

# launch-analytics

## Inputs

- `$request`: the launch source and the site/stack. When invoked by a launch skill, the caller passes the
  **channel** (the hyphenated on-disk launch slug, e.g. `product-hunt` — this is the output dir), the
  **`utm_source`** GA value (e.g. `producthunt`, no hyphen), and the target links. Standalone, ask for the
  source, the site URL, and the current analytics stack (default the channel slug from the source).

## Goal

A **launch attribution kit** written to `.ulpi/launch/<channel>/analytics.md`: a consistent UTM scheme, a
per-link UTM map, the GA4 (or existing-stack) event plan for the conversion funnel, the wiring snippets,
and a validation + read-out plan.

## Step 0: Resolve source & stack

Determine the **channel** (output dir slug, e.g. `product-hunt`) and the **`utm_source`** GA value (e.g.
`producthunt`) — keep them distinct — and detect the current analytics: look for GA4/`gtag.js`, Google Tag
Manager, Plausible/Fathom/PostHog, or none. **Success criteria**: the channel, the `utm_source`, and the
real analytics stack are known.

## Step 1: Define the UTM scheme & link map

Load `references/utm-and-events.md`. Set a single convention (lowercase, hyphenated) and produce the **UTM
map** — every launch link tagged by where it appears:

- `utm_source` = the platform (e.g. `producthunt`)
- `utm_medium` = the placement (e.g. `launch`, `maker-comment`, `email`, `social`)
- `utm_campaign` = the launch (e.g. `ph-launch-2026-06`)
- `utm_content` = the specific link (e.g. `x-thread`, `wave1-email`, `gallery-cta`)

When invoked by a launch skill, hand the tagged links back to the caller (listing/outreach) so every link
is attributable; standalone, the tagged-link map in the written artifact is the deliverable for the user
to apply. **Success criteria**: one scheme, and a tagged link for every place a link appears.

## Step 2: Map the funnel & events

Define the conversion funnel and the events that mark each step — typically `page_view` (automatic) →
`sign_up` → a key **activation** event (the first real value moment). Mark `sign_up` and activation as
**conversions/key events** in GA4. **Success criteria**: each funnel step has a named event and the
key ones are flagged as conversions.

## Step 3: Wire it

Provide the tracking snippets for the real stack (GA4 `gtag('event', …)` or the equivalent), verified
against current docs, plus where to add them. Keep it minimal and consent-aware.
**Success criteria**: copy-paste wiring that fits the stack and doesn't double-fire.

## Step 4: Validate & read out

Give a validation step (GA4 **DebugView** / **Realtime** to confirm events fire with the right params) and
a simple read-out plan: where to see launch-day traffic by `utm_source`, signups by source, and the
funnel conversion. **Success criteria**: the user can confirm tracking works before launch and read the
result after.

## Step 5: Persist the kit

Write everything above to `.ulpi/launch/<channel>/analytics.md` (creating the directory if needed): the UTM
scheme + tagged-link map, the funnel/events plan, the wiring snippets, and the validate/read-out steps. The
`<channel>` is the hyphenated launch slug the caller passes (e.g. `product-hunt`), distinct from
`utm_source`. **Success criteria**: a durable, paste-ready `analytics.md` exists on disk.

## Guardrails

- No PII in UTMs or event params; honor consent/GDPR.
- One documented scheme; lowercase; reused across every link.
- Extend the existing stack; don't double-instrument or break consent gating.
- Track signups/activation, not just visits; durable outcomes over vanity.
- Verify GA4/gtag syntax against current docs; adapt to the real stack.
- Report only real numbers; never fabricate.

## When To Load References

- `references/utm-and-events.md` — the UTM convention + per-link map, the GA4 event taxonomy and
  conversion setup, the wiring snippet pattern, and validation (Steps 1–4).

## Output Contract

Write / return `.ulpi/launch/<channel>/analytics.md`:

1. the UTM scheme + a tagged-link map for every launch link
2. the funnel and its events, with `sign_up`/activation flagged as conversions
3. the wiring snippet(s) for the real stack (verified against current docs)
4. a validation step (DebugView/Realtime) and a read-out plan (traffic/signups by source)

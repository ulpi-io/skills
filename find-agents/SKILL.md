  Search, install, list, remove, update, or scaffold AI agents with the `agentshq` CLI across many
  coding CLIs and IDEs. Use when the user wants to discover agents, install them into specific
  clients, or manage an existing agent catalog.

  Use only when the user explicitly asks to find, install, list, remove, update, or scaffold

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This skill changes the user's agent inventory and must stay explicit-user-only.

Non-negotiable rules:
1. Verify `agentshq` availability before relying on it.
2. Be explicit about scope: project vs global, specific IDEs vs auto-detect.
3. Do not install or remove agents the user did not ask for.
4. Confirm ambiguous install targets before making changes.
5. Report exactly what was added, removed, or updated.

# Find Agents

## Inputs

- `$request`: Search terms, repo source, or management intent such as `list`, `remove`, or `update`

## Goal

Use `agentshq` to help the user:

- discover relevant agents
- install agents into one or more CLIs or IDEs
- list current inventory
- remove or update installed agents
- scaffold a new agent when asked

## Step 0: Verify runtime prerequisites

Check:

- Node.js availability
- `npx agentshq --version`

If the CLI is unavailable, explain the blocker and stop.

**Success criteria**: `agentshq` can be invoked from the current environment.

## Step 1: Resolve the user's intent

Determine whether the user wants to:

- search
- install
- list
- remove
- update
- scaffold

Also resolve:

- project vs global scope
- target IDEs/CLIs if specified
- source repo, URL, or local path if installing

If those details are ambiguous, ask before mutating anything.

**Success criteria**: The exact `agentshq` action is clear before execution.

## Step 2: Run the narrowest relevant command

### Command Reference

| Action | Command | Key Flags |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Search | `npx agentshq find [query]` | interactive picker when no query given |
| Install from repo | `npx agentshq add <owner>/<repo>` | `@<agent-name>` for specific agent |
| Install from URL | `npx agentshq add <url>` | also works with local paths |
| Install scope | | `-g` for global, `--ide <name> ...` for specific IDEs |
| Install options | | `--all` for all agents to all IDEs, `--list` to preview |
| List installed | `npx agentshq list` | `-g` for global, `--ide <name>`, `--json` |
| Remove | `npx agentshq remove [name]` | `-g` for global, `--all` for all agents |
| Check updates | `npx agentshq check` | |
| Apply updates | `npx agentshq update` | |
| Scaffold new | `npx agentshq init [name]` | |

When installing, respect:

- explicit `--ide ...` choices when the user gave them
- `-g` only when the user asked for global scope
- `--list` when the user wants to inspect a source before installing

### Supported IDEs

The CLI supports 43+ IDEs. Common ones:

| IDE | Format |
|-----|--------|
| Claude Code | `.md` with YAML frontmatter |
| Cursor | `AGENTS.md` sections |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agent.md` |
| Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` sections |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` sections |
| Gemini CLI | `.md` with YAML frontmatter |
| Kiro | `.json` |
| Amp | `AGENTS.md` sections |
| Roo Code | `AGENTS.md` sections |

Agents are automatically translated to each IDE's native format on install.

**Success criteria**: The command matches the user's intent and scope exactly.

## Step 3: Report the result clearly

After execution, report:

- what command ran
- which agents matched or changed
- which clients/IDEs were targeted
- any next steps such as authentication, reload, or restart

When searching, present the most relevant results instead of dumping raw output.

**Success criteria**: The user can immediately decide what to do next.

## Guardrails

- Do not run this skill proactively.
- Do not install globally unless the user asked for global scope.
- Do not remove or update agents without explicit user intent.
- Do not guess target IDE names when the user clearly cares about a specific client.
- Remember that `agentshq` can translate one source agent into multiple client formats; report that clearly.

## Output Contract

Report:

1. the resolved action
2. project/global scope
3. target IDEs or CLIs
4. the agents found or changed
5. any follow-up steps the user should know about
